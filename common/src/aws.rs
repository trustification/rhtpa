//! Detection of AWS credential configuration.
//!
//! Both the S3 storage backend and the RDS/Aurora IAM database authentication path fall
//! back to the AWS default credential provider chain when no static credentials are
//! supplied. Engaging that chain has a cost: `aws_config::defaults(..).load()` spins up
//! providers and, for the Web Identity/STS path, can reach out to AWS. When nothing in the
//! environment points at an AWS credential source there is no point paying that cost — the
//! chain would resolve to nothing anyway and any AWS request would go out unsigned.
//!
//! This module provides a cheap, side-effect-free check for whether the environment is set
//! up for the AWS default chain, so callers can skip AWS entirely when it isn't configured.

/// * a shared credentials/config file or named profile (`AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`,
///   `AWS_CONFIG_FILE`, `AWS_PROFILE`),
/// * container-provided credentials (ECS/EKS pod identity).
///
/// Note: credentials available *only* from the EC2 instance metadata service (IMDS) expose
/// no environment variable, so a bare EC2 deployment that relies on an instance-profile role
/// is not detected by these variables alone. Because IMDS cannot be probed cheaply or without
/// a network side effect, such deployments opt in explicitly via [`AWS_USE_IMDS_ENV_VAR`].
