# Snapshots for tests

Some tests require not only a database, but also an imported dataset. Depending on the dataset, the import can run
for several minutes, even hours, before the actual test runs. In order to speed this up, it is possible to leverage
BTRFS' subvolumes and snapshots.

The idea is to run the import once, but then, before running tests, create a snapshot of it. Tests then run against
a freshly instantiated snapshot from that import. This takes seconds rather than minutes or hours.

## Requirements

* Run on Linux, with BTRFS available
* Have the `btrfs` command line tool installed
* Have a BTRFS volume mounted, with the following options: `defaults,user,exec,user_subvol_rm_allowed`
* Set `TRUST_TEST_BTRFS_STORE` to a directory which is on such a volume, otherwise the current working directory is used, which must be on a BTRFS volume with those options

## Maintenance

It may happen that, at the end of a run, subvolumes don't get cleaned up. You can check using the following command:

```bash
sudo btrfs subvolume list .
```

Subvolumes in `templates` are expected to be kept, while the ones in `running` and `prepare` are expected to be
short-lived and removed after a test was run.

## Alternatives

If the requirements are not met (non-Linux platform, missing `btrfs` tool, or the store path is not on a BTRFS
filesystem), tests will automatically fall back to creating a temporary directory per test and running import
operations every time. This is slower, but does run tests.
