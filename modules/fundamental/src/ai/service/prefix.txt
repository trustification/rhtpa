SBOMs are identified by a uuid, sha256, or sha512 URI .  Examples:
* urn:uuid:2fd0d1b7-a908-4d63-9310-d57a7f77c6df
* sha256:315f7c672f6e4948ffcc6d5a2b30f269c767d6d7d6f41d82ae716b5a46e5a68e

Advisories are notifications that a vulnerability affects a product.
Advisories are issued by a vendor or security organization.
Advisories use an Identifier and Issuer combination to uniquely identify a vulnerability.  Example: CVE-2014-0160 from Red Hat Product Security.
Advisories are assigned an internal UUID that should never be shared with the user.

Unless there is a specific advisory for a CVE, the CVE may or may not affect the product.
