//! Third-party semantic validators run during ingestion.
//!
//! A [`Validator`] inspects a raw document (before it is parsed into the graph)
//! and returns a structured [`ValidationReport`]. Validators run in one of two
//! modes: [`ValidationMode::Report`] (findings are recorded but never block) or
//! [`ValidationMode::Verify`] (a failing outcome blocks ingestion).
//!
//! See ADR 00020 for the design and rationale.
